There are 3 ways to define time complexity of any algorithm
Best Case (Constant Time) -->Not possible
Average Case (Linear Time)
Worst Case (Linear TIme)
Asymptotic Notations:
--------------------
Big O - Exact or Upper Bound (Linear Time)
Theta - Exact (Constant Time)
Omega - Exact or Lower Bound (Linear Time)
